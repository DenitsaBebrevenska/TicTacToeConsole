I made two versions of the game Tic Tac Toe for Windows Console.

 The latter gives the option to the players once the game is finished (either win or tie) to either restart the game or quit.

 At that point I`m trying to use as much methods as I can and  I am still far from OOP quite obviously.

Had fun doing these though!
